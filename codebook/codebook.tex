\section{polidoc.net- The Political Documents Archive}
The Political Documents Archive contains election manifestos, coalition agreements, government declarations and various other documents of political actors from developed democracies. Currently, the archive builds on a stock of more than 3000 political documents (June 27, 2018: 1230 national and 2184 subnational manifestos) from currently 26 European countries. The aim of the repository is to provide political texts in order to facilitate scholarly research in different areas of comparative politics such as party competition, coalition politics, legislative decision-making or electoral behavior. National electoral manifestos have been collected in the course of the REPCONG project, and the archive includes party manifestos for regional elections in several European democracies. Because the process of European integration resulted in a strengthening of regions in EU member states and in countries that want to join the European Union, the relevance of the regional level for political decision-making has increased during the last decades. Therefore, also the policy profiles of regional parties are required to get a full picture of democratic responsiveness in European states across all levels of the political system. The collection of regional manifestos and national manifestos since 2013 (currently: 2427 texts) was supported by the COHESIFY project (www.cohesify.eu), funded under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The aim of COHESIFY is to study whether the European Structural and Investment Funds affect people’s support for and identification with the European project.

The archive is freely accessible (after a simple registration) and meant to foster rigorous research in these areas by enabling scholars to produce valid and reliable findings from empirical studies of textual data rather than unnecessarily struggling to obtain and process texts. While polidoc.net is an open access archive it also aims to establish a network for exchanging and accessing political text data once it has been checked for errors and assured for quality. The archive therefore encourages researchers to share their documents with others. We invite everybody to participate in this project so that the political science community can easily make use of already collected documents.

\section{Countries, elections and parties covered}
The REPCONG project has collected national electoral manifestos of parties in 20 countries until 2012: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
The COHESIFY project has focused on Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Italy, Netherlands, UK and Spain. Polidoc.net currently houses regional documents collected in the course of the project from Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Italy (Lombardy) and the United Kingdom. 
The time period covered mainly encompasses 1980 onwards for national manifestos and 2000 onwards for regional documents, partially reaching farther back. See below for details. 

The selection rules for national documents from western European countries are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 	Include all parties with at least 1\% of the (valid) votes in the election for which the manifesto was written
\item 	If the sum of votes covered is less than 95\%, include the next largest parties until 95\% are covered
\item 	For all parties that sometimes are in the selection and sometimes not, include one additional observation before and after their appearance(s)
\end{enumerate}
For the post-communist European countries, only steps 1 and 2 from above apply.

\section{Archive and file Structure }
The structure of the files is as follows: Each file is labeled with a 5-digit code. The codes are based on the rules used by the CMP group as described in Budge et al. (2001: 193).\footnote{Budge, Ian, Hans-Dieter Klingemann, Andrea Volkens, Judith Bara and Eric Tanenbaum. 2001. \textit{Mapping Policy Preferences: Estimates for Parties, Electors and Governments} 1945-1998. Oxford: Oxford University Press.} The first two numbers indicate the country, the next two numbers indicate the party family, while the last one is for the number of the party if several parties of the same party family are coded. Codes for parties previously not covered by the CMP group have been extended to previously uncoded parties following the coding rules of the CMP. 


\section{Formatting Rules for Manifestos}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Starting from a PDF, removal of page numbers, headers, footnotes, donation and membership calls as well as indexes and registers, keeping titles and forewords. 
\item Removal or correction of unusual characters and formatting resulting from flawed scans or conversions (comparison with PDF of the manifesto).
\item Check for and add missing sentences and paragraphs (if possible from original source, preferably PDF).
\item Reassembling of hyphenations.
\item Substituting bullet points, enumerations and other structuring characters including Roman and Arabic numerals with a dash (-).
\item (Uniform) spell check (Word).
\item Saving of corrected manifestos as non-formatted text files (.txt) with UTF-8 coding. The format grants cross-platform use of the texts.
\end{enumerate}
